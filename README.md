Blocks formatted like so:

```
# BEGIN [DEVICE]
[...]
# END [DEVICE]
```

~~are~~, *~~will~~, **should,** eventually be* parsed by [qualia](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mir.qualia/), which enables or disables them by commenting them out depending on which device they're used on.

This directory tree is [managed](https://taihen.org/managing-dotfiles-with-gnu-stow/) by [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) which symlinks files in a directory to their respective place in the $HOME tree.

**That's it! Neat right?**

## **Definitely!**
